# Sales-Tax in C++
## Problem Statement 
### Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt. 
### Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions. When I purchase items, I receive a receipt that lists the rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.
###
### Ideally I could have done it in a more acceptable OOP conventional approach but I just wanted to finish the test due to other work commitments.
###
### An ideal OOP approach would be to devide up salestax.cpp into:
### * Item.h
### * ItemCreator.h
### * InventoryList.h
### * SalesTax.h
### * Item.cpp
### * ItemCreator.cpp
### * SalesTax.cpp
### * main.cpp
